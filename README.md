- **Validation Logic:** 
  - Checks for:
    - Required fields
    - Valid email format
    - Minimum and maximum character limits for text inputs  

- **Customizable:** 
  - The form and validation logic can be easily modified for different use cases.

## Tech Stack

- **CSS:** Styled the form for a clean and visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented validation logic and real-time feedback for user inputs.
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code for development.

## How It Works
1. **Real-Time Input Validation:**  
   As users type in their information, JavaScript checks the data for:
   - Empty fields
   - Proper email formatting
   - Character length for names and messages  

2. **Error Messages:**  
   Clear, descriptive error messages appear dynamically next to the fields needing attention.

3. **Form Submission:**  
   The form can only be submitted when all fields are valid, ensuring proper data collection.
